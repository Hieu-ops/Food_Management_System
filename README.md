# FOOD MANAGEMENT SYSTEM - Group 8

## Project Overview

**Food Management System** is a web-based application developed as the **final project** for the course **INS3064 – Multimedia Design and Web Development**. The project aims to apply theoretical and practical knowledge of web design, dynamic website development, and database management to build a functional food ordering and management system.

The system allows **Administrators (Admin)** to manage food items, users, orders, and revenue statistics, while **Users** can browse food items, place orders, and make payments through the website.
